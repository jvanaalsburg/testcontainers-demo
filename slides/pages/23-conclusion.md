# Conclusion

Great option for database-backed projects

::left::

### Pros

- Reliable test environment
- Separate from local development database
- Painless schema changes
- Can run tests in parallel
- Requires relatively little code

::right::

### But...

- Running in Docker requires some additional steps
- Impact on performance is unknown (to me)
- Have only used this for a single service
